<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>As mentioned before, a module of <strong>OPPAS</strong> is divided into two parts: the <strong>link</strong> and the <strong>joint</strong>.
The link's main objective is to give structure to the robot and it has a big influence on the total length of the robot.
In addition it will house the components (e.g., batteries, sensors, microcontroller boards).
Depending on the robot you need, you may skip the link altogether and just put together a bunch of joints.</p>
<h2 id="link-of-oppas">Link of OPPAS</h2>
<p>The link is divided into two sets of parts: the <em>skeleton</em> and the <em>flesh</em>.
The main role of the skeleton is to provide the structure of the robot.
The main parts of the skeleton are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Part</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left">spine</td>
<td align="left">Provides the main support for the link</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">ribs</td>
<td align="left">Additional strucutre to attach the flesh components to the spine</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left">caps</td>
<td align="left">It helps to put all together and enclose the internal components. It also provides an iterface with the joint's parts</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="spine">Spine</h3>
<p>The design of the spine provides a flexible way to attach extra components.
The idea is that you can design a specific base for the components you use, and then attach it to the spine.
The spine has a set of rails and the geometry of these can be controlled parametrically.
The final length of the spine is controlled by the number of segments (rail's teeth + spacing) and the geometry of these.</p>
<p><img alt="spine.png" src="../../img/spine.png" title="The spine" /></p>
<p>The main parameters of the spine that can be changed are summarized as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Spine's parameter</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>spineInnerDiameter</code></td>
<td align="left">The spine has an hexagonal cross-section, circumscribed on a circle with a diameter called <code>spineInnerDiameter</code>. A set of four M2.5 screw holes are automatically generated, coincident with a circle 80% the size of <code>spineInnerDiameter</code>. This allows the holes to be generated automatically and always consistent with the spine diameter. Change this parameter to a fixed value if you require it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>rail*</code></td>
<td align="left">The set of parameters related to the rail design (<code>railNeck</code>, <code>railWidth</code>, <code>railInnerWidth</code>, <code>railHeight</code>) controls the geometry of the cross-section of the rail. The parameters <code>railSpacing</code> and <code>railThickness</code> control their geometry along the longitudinal axis of the spine. One 'segment' is composed of one rail's segment (I sometimes call them teeth) and a spacing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>noSegments</code></td>
<td align="left">Number of segments (rail's tooth + its spacing) composing the spine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>linkLength</code></td>
<td align="left">The final length of the link is controlled by how many segments (a tooth and its spacing) you need, and its size controlled by <code>railSpacing</code> and <code>railThickness</code>. If you need a constant rail just set <code>railSpacing</code>=0, <code>railThickness</code>=desired length, and <code>noSegments</code>=1. This allows to generate a link always consistent with a discrete number of teeth.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="rib">Rib</h3>
<p>The main role of the ribs is to attach the flesh components to the spine.
A secondary objective I had into mind is to also provide a strucutre to attach extra components (e.g., sensors) if required.
However, I have not implemented this yet.</p>
<p>Once the three components of the flesh are slided into the ribs, their movement is constrained without the need of extra parts, like bolts or screws.
The model of <strong>OPPAS</strong> that can be currently downloaded does not provide additional holes to attach the vertebras to the spine.
It relies completely on friction and the form-closure achieved when the <em>flesh</em> parts are attached.
This is to keep the design consistent and avoid problems, since a screw hole of a given size may not be compatible with the user's chosen <code>railThickness</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="rib.png" src="../../img/rib.png" title="The ribs" /></p>
<p>The main parameters of the ribs that can be changed are summarized as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Rib's parameter</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>midCircle</code></td>
<td align="left">This parameter is seen along several parts of <strong>OPPAS</strong>. For the ribs, it works along <code>outerCircle</code> to generate the strucutre of the ribs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>outerCircle</code></td>
<td align="left">This parameter controls the size of the ribs. An equilaterla triangle is inscribed into a circle with diameter <code>outerCircle</code> and used to control the rib's size. <strong>Note</strong>: The parameters <code>midCircle</code> and <code>outerCircle</code> should always follow the constraing: <code>|outerCircle| &gt; |midCircle|</code>. I have not found a good bound on this value (since the geometry is influenced by other parameters), but try to keep it with at least a 10[mm] difference.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>ribCircle</code></td>
<td align="left">Final parameter to control the size of the rib. This parameter is not used in any other part of the design.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="caps-also-called-modulecaps">Caps (also called moduleCaps)</h3>
<p>The caps enclose the link and provide an interface with the joints.
In addition, the interior of the caps accomodates to the ribs for extra support.
Four slots are provided to pass cables, which location and size can be controlled by the user.
Additional pegs provide extra strength to the design to avoid rotations along the longitudinal axis.</p>
<p><img alt="caps.png" src="../../img/caps.png" title="The caps" /></p>
<p>The main parameters of the caps that can be changed are summarized as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Cap's parameter</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>capDiameter</code></td>
<td align="left">The outer diameter of the caps. It should be at least as big as <code>outerCircle</code>, but I recommend it a little bigger. In current implementation of <strong>OPPAS</strong>, the value is set as <code>capDiameter = 1.1*outerCircle</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>outerCircle</code></td>
<td align="left">Outer circle will be the diameter of the cap contacting the joint's parts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>capThickness</code></td>
<td align="left">Thickness od the cap (not considering the internal cavity where the ribs fit).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>slotDiameter</code></td>
<td align="left">Control the location of the slots. In the current design of <strong>OPPAS</strong>, the parameter is set as <code>slotDiameter = 0.5*midCircle</code> to keep the design consistent. If requiered, change this to a fixed value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>slotThikness</code></td>
<td align="left">Thickness of the slots.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>slotLength</code></td>
<td align="left">Length of the slots.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>slotHole</code></td>
<td align="left">Diameter of the slot's hole. Use this to pass cables with connectors. In general, I advice <code>slotHole</code> to be at least 10[mm].</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>midCircle</code></td>
<td align="left">A set of four pegs are generated automatically at a circle with this diameter. If needed, change this to a fixed value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>capPegDiam</code></td>
<td align="left">Diameter of the pegs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>capPegDepth</code></td>
<td align="left">Length of the pegs. I use 'depth' since a matching hole is generated into other parts.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="flesh">Flesh</h3>
<p>The <em>flesh</em> components are the main interface between the robot and the exterior.
These parts can be designed independently from the rest of the design, but I provide a set of parts as an example.
The <em>flesh</em> parts slide into the ribs and provide extra constraints.
Once all parts of the flesh are inserted, the ribs should not be able to come apart from the spine.</p>
<p><img alt="flesh.png" src="../../img/flesh.png" title="The flesh" /></p>
<p>The main parameters of the flesh that can be changed are summarized as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Flesh's parameter</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>fleshInnerDiameter</code></td>
<td align="left">The inner diameter of the flesh parts is controlled by this parameter. The strength and available space inside the robot are affected. The outer size is the same as <code>capDiameter</code>. You can change these values accordint to your application.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>ribRail*</code></td>
<td align="left">The set of parameters (<code>ribRailThickness</code>, <code>ribRailWidth</code>, and <code>ribRailDepth</code>) control the geometry of the rails that slide into the ribs. There is a built-in tolerance for the rails, so that they fit correctly into the ribs even if there is shrinking of the material.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The <em>flesh</em> parts in <strong>OPPAS</strong> Mk. 1 should not be considered as a definite design.
The purpose of <strong>OPPAS</strong> is that they can be redesigned to accomodate to your needs, without needing to change (drastically) the rest of the parts.
Several designs of the <em>flesh</em> could be designed and used in the same base robot.
Chek the section <strong>Optional parts</strong> for a description of some parts that have been designed so far.</p>
<p>A <em>flesh</em> part with the <a href="http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/se/~shugen/">BioInMech</a> (Biomimetic Intellignet Mechatronics) Laboratory is provided.</p>
<p><img alt="flesh_logo.png" src="../../img/flesh_logo.png" title="BioInMech Logo in flesh" /></p>
<h2 id="joint-of-oppas">Joint of OPPAS</h2>
<p>The joint of <strong>OPPAS</strong> is composed of two parts: <em>uBracket</em> and <em>servoBase</em>.
These are the parts that would requiere the most effort from the user if another servo is used.
I apologize for this, but I have not found a good and reliable way to parametrize this, since the desgin of servomotros is in general very inconsistent.
<strong>OPPAS</strong> Mk. 1.0 is designed with Dynamixel MX-64AR servos in mind.
However, some  of the parameters can be changed by the user to get a design as close as possible as the one requiered.</p>
<h3 id="ubracket">uBracket</h3>
<p>The <em>uBracket</em> connects the servo's horn to the link, providing motion.
There are four slots, designed so that the link can be connected with a 90[deg] angle to provide flexibility in the construction of your robot.
If the axes of all servos are parallel, the result is what is known as 'planar snake robot'.
What is known as 'serpentine' or 'undulatory' locomotion can be achieved.
With the motors connected with an offset of 90[deg], 3D motions can be achieved.
However, I cannot guarantee the robustness of the current implementation of <strong>OPPAS</strong>, sine 3D motion usually comes with impacts and additional interaction with the environment.</p>
<p><img alt="ubracket.png" src="../../img/ubracket.png" title="The uBracket" /></p>
<p>The outer diameter of the uBracket is controlled by <code>capDiameter</code> and the slots are designed to math the ones in the module caps.
The main parameters of the uBracket that can be changed are summarized as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="left">Flesh's parameter</th>
<th align="left">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>uBracketThickness</code></td>
<td align="left">Thickness of the uBracket.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left"><code>hornLength</code></td>
<td align="left">Distance from the uBracket base to the axis of the servomotor. The longer <code>hornLength</code>is, the bigger the range of motion of the joint. However, this means a weaker uBracket.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="servobase">servoBase</h3>
<p>The servoBase of <strong>OPPAS</strong> is designed for the MX-64AR servos of ROBOTIS. Therefore, no extra parameters are provided to the user.</p>
<p><img alt="servobase.png" src="../../img/servobase.png" title="The servoBase" /></p>
<h2 id="result">Result</h2>
<p>The final module obtained can be seen in the following picture.</p>
